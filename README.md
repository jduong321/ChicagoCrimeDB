Introduction to N-Tier applications by my Professor.

Problem: The file that contained the project was filled with SQL related statements that would be difficult to read.
Our professor told us that in the real world developers would seperate the project down in order to keep it more organized, secure it,
and in the end it would be easier to manage. He gave us the seperation of the data tier and logic tier as a template and wanted us to 
make the project work again.
